## Project Narrative

The OMW (On-Demand Service Platform) represents a hybrid solution combining Urban Company's home services model with Ola/Rapido's ride-hailing capabilities. The platform successfully delivers a comprehensive ecosystem supporting five distinct stakeholder groups, each with specialized interfaces and functionality. The current implementation provides robust authentication systems, booking management, and administrative oversight capabilities across all user types. The technology stack leverages React for web interfaces, Node.js for backend services, and MySQL for data persistence, creating a scalable foundation for the platform's continued development. Key integrations including Google Maps API, payment gateways, and real-time communication systems are identified as priority items for the next development phase, ensuring the platform meets enterprise-grade requirements for security, performance, and user experience.
