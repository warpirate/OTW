# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The OMW Progressive Mobile Application will extend the existing web platform to provide native mobile experiences for customers, service providers (workers), drivers, admins, and super admins. This mobile app will leverage Progressive Web App (PWA) technologies while maintaining seamless integration with your current Node.js/React/MySQL backend infrastructure. The mobile application will enhance your existing multi-role authentication system and provide mobile-specific features such as real-time tracking, push notifications, offline capabilities, and camera integration.
